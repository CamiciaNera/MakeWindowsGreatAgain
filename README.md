# MakeWindowsGreatAgain

# FOR INSTRUCTIONS SEE BELOW

This script aims to optimize Windows 10 and 11 by removing unuseful features and apps, as well as reducing idle RAM usage by disabling services you don't likely need to be running every time.

## Features:

### 1. Removes bloatware (preinstalled) unuseful apps;
### 2. Optimizes privacy settings (disables Cortana, Clipboard History and other crap)
### 3. Deletes registry keys which launch background programs at boot
### 4. Disables unuseful services and puts other in Manual mode (they will be started only if you need them)
### 5. Tries to remove the non-installed bloatware apps from the Start Menu.


## You can download from the Releases page.
### Extract the script and run "RUN ME AS ADMIN.bat", as administrator obviously.
### It is recommended to update Windows and drivers first, and then run the script.

### If you want to contribute, feel free to create a Pull Request in "untested" branch. Your suggestion will be tested and committed directly to the main branch.
