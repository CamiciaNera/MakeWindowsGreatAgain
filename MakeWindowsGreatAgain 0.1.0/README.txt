You have to manually enable the unrestricted scripts to run the debloater (until I do a proper bat file which does so).

To do so, open PowerShell as administrator and run:

Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

then cd to the script location and run

.\main.ps1

It will open the script and start doing its stuff.

If you can, record the screen via OBS and send it as issue so I can see what does the script actually do.

IMPORTANT: RUN IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE UNTIL THE FINAL VERSION RELEASES! I AM NOT SURE IF THIS SCRIPT IS WORKING CORRECTLY UNTIL I GET YOUR FEEDBACK!
